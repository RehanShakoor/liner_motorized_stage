# liner_motorized_stage

About project :  
Developed a fully functional working model of a linear motorized stage with precise motion control.  
Stepper motors are utilized for all motions, ensuring accurate and consistent movement during operation.  
Arduino Nano is used, there is a controller (LCD + Keypad) to effectively manage and control the stageâ€™s motion.  
Successfully utilized the motorized stage to test thin film super capacitors in our Physics Lab experiments.
